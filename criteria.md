# Acceptance criteria — The Unofficial Guide

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this system, written in unit 1
**before** any results existed.

An acceptance criterion names a target: a number, a count, a rate, or something
a person could plainly observe. *"Retrieval works"* is an opinion. *"For at
least 4 of my 5 test questions, the top results include a chunk containing the
answer"* is a criterion.

Under each one, write a sentence or two on **why that target** and not a
stricter or looser one. A reason that says something about your corpus or your
pipeline earns credit; *"80% seemed reasonable"* does not.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include one that
contains the answer.

**Why this target:**
<!-- e.g. "One of my questions is about a topic only two documents mention, so
     I expect that one to be hard." -->

---

## 2. Every answer names a source

Every answer the system produces names at least one source document.

**Why this target:**
<!-- Why all five and not four? What about your setup makes that achievable —
     or what would have to go wrong for it not to be? -->

---

## 3. The relevance gate stops out-of-corpus questions

When I ask a question my documents clearly don't cover, the relevance gate
stops it and the system returns "I don't have enough information about that" —
in at least 4 of 5 tries.

<!-- The five questions are the ones in `OUT_OF_SCOPE` at the bottom of
     `questions.py`, and `run_eval.py` puts them through the gate and writes
     what happened into your run log. Swap them for your own if you'd rather —
     just keep five of them, or the "4 of 5" above has nothing to be 4 of. -->

**Why this target:**
<!-- What did your distances look like when you set the cutoff in Milestone 4?
     Was there a clean gap, or did the two groups overlap? -->

## 4. Chunks read as complete thoughts

At least 4 of 5 sampled chunks read as a complete thought, with no sentence
cut in half at either end.

**Why this target:** On `campus_life`, indexing produces 88 chunks from 88
documents (317 characters on average, shortest 178, longest 549) — the
800-character fallback chunker never actually splits anything, since every
post is shorter than that. So "right-sized" here mostly checks that the
chunker left each post intact rather than that it made a good cut. I picked
4 of 5 instead of 5 of 5 because a few posts (like the dining hall
follow-ups) are short replies to another post and might read as slightly
incomplete without the original — I want room to notice that without failing
the criterion outright.

---

## 5. Named source is the correct source

For at least 4 of 5 test questions, the source named in the answer is the
document that actually contains the answer — not merely any document that
got retrieved and cited.

**Why this target:** Criterion 2 only checks that an answer names *a* source
at all, which a system could satisfy while citing the wrong file. This one
checks correctness of attribution, which matters more on this corpus because
several topics are split across near-duplicate documents (e.g.
`housing_morrow_house.txt` vs. `housing_morrow_house_laundry.txt` vs.
`housing_morrow_house_noise.txt`) — it would be easy for the system to name
a plausible-looking but wrong file from the same cluster. I used 4 of 5, the
same bar as my other criteria, since I have no reason yet to think this is
harder or easier than the others.

     UNIT 2 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath it, like this:

         ## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

         For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include
         one that contains the answer.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 2:** For at least 4 of 5 questions, the top three
         > results contain the answer.
         >
         > **Why revised:** I couldn't judge "the chunks include one that
         > contains the answer" the same way twice — I scored two questions
         > differently on Monday than on Wednesday. The new version is
         > something I can actually check.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "I said 4 of 5 but got 2 of 5, so 2 of 5 is more realistic."

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.

     The whole reason the originals stay visible is so someone can see what you
     said before you knew the answer.
